## Creating markdown that can be rendered easily on my portfolio

- links should look like this:

```
[Visible link text](https://link.url "alt text goes here")
```

- images should use an 'img' tag
  - can then set explicit height and width and add alt text:

```
<img alt="basic module federation diagram with one container app and three remotes" width="687px" height="427px" src="image.png">
```

- use the following for code blocks (always add js):

````
```js
your code here
```
````
