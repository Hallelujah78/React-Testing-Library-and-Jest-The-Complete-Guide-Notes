# React Testing Library and Jest: The Complete Guide

- course commenced 6/11/23 - 20:27pm.

---

## 1. How to Get Help

- just intro

---

## 2. Join Our Community!

- intro stuff

---

---

## 3. Start Testing... Now!

- [basic start project](http://www.codesandbox.io/s/rtl-starter-sq54b4 "starter project where we can start writing tests straight away")
- outline core functionality of the app
  - app starts up
  - 6 products visible
  - click load more button
  - 12 products visible
- test 1
  - when app starts, we see six products
- test 2
  - if we click load more, we see 12 products
- steps
  - create App.test.js in src
    - our App.test.js:

```js
import { render, screen, waitFor } from "@testing-library/react";
import user from "@testing-library/user-event";
import App from "./App";

test("shows 6 products by default", async () => {
  render(<App />);
  const headings = await screen.findAllByRole("heading");
  expect(headings).toHaveLength(6);
});
test("clicking on the button loads 6 more products", async () => {
  render(<App />);

  const button = await screen.findByRole("button", {
    name: /load more/i,
  });
  await user.click(button);
  await waitFor(async () => {
    const headings = await screen.findAllByRole("heading");
    expect(headings).toHaveLength(12);
  });
});
```

- to run the tests in codesandbox, click the 'tests' tab above the preview window
  - tests will run automatically or you can click on the play button
  - testing in codesandbox is buggy so you may have to refresh the page to get it to work
  - both of the tests pass

---

---

## 4. A few critical questions

- What were all those import statements?
- How were our tests found?
- What did all the testing code do?

<img alt="" width="653px" height="366px" src="image.png">

- @testing-library/react
  - takes component and renders it
  - uses ReactDOM
- user-event
  - simulate user input
- @testing-library/dom
  - automatically included in our project by testing-library/react
  - helps us find our elements
- jest

- how were our tests found?
  - Jest finds files in the src folder that
    - end with .spec.js
    - end with .test.js
    - are placed in a folder called `__test__`
    - they just have to satisfy one of these criteria
    - it assumes they contain tests
      - jest will automatically execute them
- what did the testing code do?
  - we call the builtin 'test' function
    - describes the test and calls a callback function that contains testing code
    - `render(<App/>)` renders the app component
    - used `screen` to find all elements that have the `heading` role
      - find out more about roles later
    - `expect(headings).toHaveLength(6)` - there should be 6 headings
      - anything other than 6 fails the test

---

## 5. Project Setup

- what we'll do now
  - make a simple project and test it
- later
  - we'll look at a large prebuilt project with complex features, and we'll test and add new features
- the simple project
  - form where user can enter in information (name, email)
  - the user can click submit and the details are added to a list of users
- Stephen is using create-react-app

  - I'll try to follow along with Vite
  - create a new vite React project called 'users'

---

## 11. Our first test

- Test writing process

  - Pick out one component to test by itself
  - make a test file for the component if one does not exist
  - decide what the important parts of the component are
  - write a test to make sure each part works as expected
  - run tests at the command line

  - test UserForm.jsx
    - create UserForm.test.js
    - important parts are:
      - show two inputs and one button
      - entering a name and email and submitting causes onUserAdd to be called

- tests have a similar format
  - render the component
  - manipulate the component (simulate typing, etc)
  - assertion - make sure it's doing what we expect it to
- our UserForm.test.js looks like this:

```js
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import { user } from "@testing-library/user-event";
import UserForm from "./UserForm";

test("it shows two inputs and a button", async () => {
  // render the component
  render(<UserForm />);

  // manipulate the component or find an element in it
  const inputs = screen.getAllByRole("textbox");
  const button = screen.getByRole("button");

  // Assertion - make sure component is doing what we expect it to do
  expect(inputs).toHaveLength(2);
  expect(button).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

- incidentally, [this](https://zaferayan.medium.com/how-to-setup-jest-and-react-testing-library-in-vite-project-2600f2d04bdd "perfect guide for adding jest to a Vite react project") guide 100% works for adding Jest to a new Vite react project
- running our tests with `npm run test` we get:

```js
> users@0.0.0 test
> jest

 PASS  src/components/UserForm.test.js
  âˆš it shows two inputs and a button (127 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        3.201 s
Ran all test suites.
```

---

## 12. Element Query System

- what happens when we run our tests?

  - executed in NodeJS environment
    - fake browser environment with `render()` with JSDOM
  - can manipulate or select elements using `screen` from rtl

- important part of testing is finding the elements that our component has created
  - test form submission
    - must find the button to click
  - test navigation
    - find a link to click
  - make sure element is visible
    - need to find the element
- system to find elements is tedious to use
- we use query functions to find elements we have rendered
- React Testing Library Query System provides approx 48 query functions
  - getByRole()
  - findAllByDisplayValue()
  - queryAllByRole()
  - queryByRole()
  - findByRole()
  - queryByLabelText()
  - findAllByTitle()
  - findByTitle()
  - getByLabelText()
- the names of the functions have a lot of meaning in terms of which to use when

---

## 13. Understanding ARIA roles

- getAllByRole and getByRole
- role refers too ARIA roles
  - they clarify the purpose of html element
  - traditionally used by screen readers
  - many html elements have implicit/automatically assigned roles
  - elements can be manually assigned a role
  - implicit assignment:
    <img src="./www.udemy.com_course_react-testing-library-and-jest_learn_lecture_35701626.png" alt="a diagram of some implicit ARIA roles and corresponding html elements">
- this ARIA role system is the preferred way of finding elements that have been rendered by our components
  - RTL pushes you in this direction
  - this means we need to understand ARIA role system

---

## 14. Understanding Jest matchers

- this refers to assertions which are our `expect()` functions
- expect is provided by Jest
- matchers are typically chained on our expect assertion like so:

```js
expect(inputs).toHaveLength(2);
```

- `toHaveLength` is a matcher
- there are Jest matchers and RTL matchers
- some Jest matchers
  - toHaveLength
  - toEqual
  - toContain
  - toThrow
  - toHaveBeenCalled
- some RTL matchers
  - toBeInTheDocument
  - toBeEnabled
  - toHaveClass
  - toHaveTextContent
  - toHaveValue
- Jest matchers are general purpose, can test any javascript
  - full list of jest matchers [here](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect "list of jest expect matchers")
- RTL matchers
  - jest-dom provides these extra matchers
  - more concerned with DOM elements
    - is present
    - has text, has attribute, etc
- a full list of RTL jest-dom matchers is available [here](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom#custom-matchers "a list of jest-dom custom matchers on github")

---

## 15. Test was not wrapped in act(...) warning and test failure

- a quick note about warnings related to act(...). This relates to RTL v14 update and CRA not updating its version of RTL.
- user events are now async
  - just have to make the test callback async and use await a bunch

---

## 16. Simulating User Events

- we're testing we can enter a name and email and click submit and then the onUserAdd function gets called
- we'll write a bad implementation of the test that works and fix it later
  - there are many different ways to write tests
  - one way might be better than another way
- to simulate clicks and keyboard entry we use the `user` object from RTL

```js
user.click(element);
user.keyboard("asdf");
user.keyboard("{Enter}");
```

---

## 17. Recording function calls

- it's easier to interpret results in the terminal if we just run one test file at a time sometimes
- run a single test in Jest:
- you can `npm i -g jest-cli` and then run `jest Component.test.js`
- if we run our tests, we'll get an error that states that onUserAdd is not defined
  - remember, this is the prop being passed to UserForm from App.jsx
  - since we are testing UserForm standalone, there is no prop or App.jsx for that matter!
- one way to fix this is to add an empty arrow function as follows:

```js
render(<UserForm onUserAdd={() => {}} />);
```

- the purpose of this test is to make sure it gets called, and called with the correct name and email, so this approach makes the error go away but isn't a good test
- how can we do this (badly for now)?
  - above our `render()` we define a new function and declare an array

```js
const argList = [];
const callBack = (...args) => {
  argList.push(args);
};
```

- now, when we submit our form, we can use argList to verify that our function was called and it was called with appropriate arguments
- like so:

```js
expect(argList).toHaveLength(1); // our callback got called at least one time
expect(argList[0][0]).toEqual({ name: "gavan", email: "gavan@email.com" });
```

- running our test we do actually get the `act(...)` warning
  - must update to v14 of rtl
- running our tests again, we get:

```js
 PASS  src/components/UserForm.test.js
  âˆš it shows two inputs and a button (131 ms)
  âˆš it calls onUserAdd when form is submitted (544 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       2 passed, 2 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        3.306 s, estimated 4 s
Ran all test suites matching /userform.test.js/i.
```

- our tests are working, but it's not the best implementation and we'll address this later
- our UserForm.test.js so far:

```js
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import user from "@testing-library/user-event";
import UserForm from "./UserForm";

test("it shows two inputs and a button", async () => {
  // render the component
  render(<UserForm />);

  // manipulate the component or find an element in it
  const inputs = screen.getAllByRole("textbox");
  const button = screen.getByRole("button");

  // Assertion - make sure component is doing what we expect it to do
  expect(inputs).toHaveLength(2);
  expect(button).toBeInTheDocument();
});

test("it calls onUserAdd when form is submitted", async () => {
  // not the best implementation
  const argList = [];
  const callBack = (...args) => {
    argList.push(args);
  };
  // try to render my component
  render(<UserForm onUserAdd={callBack} />);

  // find the two inputs
  const [nameInput, emailInput] = screen.getAllByRole("textbox");

  // simulate typing in a name
  await user.click(nameInput);
  await user.keyboard("gavan");

  // simulate typing in an email
  await user.click(emailInput);
  await user.keyboard("gavan@email.com");

  // find the button
  const button = screen.getByRole("button");

  // simulate clicking the button to submit the form
  user.click(button);

  // assertion to make sure 'onUserAdd' gets called with email and name
});
```

---

## 18 Introducing Mock Function

- we're fixing up our previous test implementation here
- argList and the callback are a hacky way to test that our function is called and called with correct args
- Jest has a tool to check just this scenario (function is called with correct args)
  - mock functions
- mock function
  - fake function that doesn't do anything
  - records when it gets called and the args it was called with
  - used very often when we need to make sure a component calls a callback
- steps
  - we create a mock function
  - we pass it down as onUserAdd prop to UserForm
  - mock func will have internal storage
    - will record how many times called
    - different args it receives when called
    - we'll simulate form submission
    - our mock func will get called
      - mock func will store arg it received
      - increase counter to record how many times called
      - we can write assertions about number of times called and args etc
- delete arg list and callback
- create a mock function like so:

```js
const mock = jest.fn();
```

- mock is now a function
- we pass it down to our component:

```js
render(<UserForm onUserAdd={mock} />);
```

- jest has builtin matchers for checking mock functions

```js
expect(mock).toHaveBeenCalled();
expect(mock).toHaveBeenCalledWith({ name: "gavan", email: "gavan@email.com" });
```

- running our tests, all pass
  - we had to stick await in front of our `user.click(button)`
- side note
  - installed nvm to let us update node and npm from the command line going forward

---

## 19. Querying elements by labels

- the next issue is:

```js
// find the two inputs
const [nameInput, emailInput] = screen.getAllByRole("textbox");
```

- we're assuming there will be only two inputs
  - we might reorder the inputs, in which case nameInput will reference the email input in the DOM
  - we might add or remove inputs
- any changes to our UserForm might make our tests begin to fail
  - this test is brittle - easy to break
    - changes will cause the test to fail even though the component may be working correctly
- a better way
  - need to understand forms, labels and inputs better
  - basic html stuff
    - if a label's 'for' attribute matches an input's 'id,' clicking on the label will focus the input
- if we make sure our label has a 'htmlFor' and the input has a matching id then we can:

```js
screen.getByLabelText(/enter email/i);
screen.getByRole("textbox", { name: /enter email/i });
```

- getByRole is using a filter object with regular expression to match the label text
- rtl prefers or recommends roles
- updating our test:

```js
// find the two inputs
const nameInput = screen.getByRole("textbox", { name: /enter name/i });
const emailInput = screen.getByRole("textbox", { name: /enter email/i });
```

- more flexible
- we can change order or add more inputs and tests won't break

---

## 20. Testing UserList

- receives array of users each with name and email
- renders table row, 2 data cells for every user
- important parts of this component?
  - shows one line per user
  - shows correct name and email for each user
- our code so far

```js
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import UserList from "./UserList";

test("render one row per user", async () => {
  // render the component
  const users = [
    { name: "gavan", email: "gavan@email.com" },
    { name: "sam", email: "sam@email.com" },
  ];
  render(<UserList users={users} />);
  // find the rows

  // assertion: correct number of rows in the table
});

test("render the name and email of each user", async () => {
  render(<UserList />);
});
```

- how do we work out what the best way to find our rows is?

---

## 21. Getting Help with query functions

- memorizing query functions to find elements is hard
- can use this helper function:

```js
screen.logTestingPlaygroundURL();
```

- this creates html rendered by your component and creates a link to view the html in the testing playground tool
  - helps you to write queries - functions to find elements
- adding this to our test file and running we get:

```js
https://testing-playground.com/#markup=DwEwlgbgfMAuCGAjANgUwAQGNnwM64F4AiXTAWkRADsBPAMQAt0ArAVwEUAFAaQGEiYsBqnghBAJ0EMoAOXgBbVMAD0QqVACi8+GGQq1+yfuGjBiAPYgaEwWIDm8CPCr6xce4+cABVNt0A6THN5VxhVI1gIsVwFUPcoGPkfP2RA4LjwsNgLKyykNDDwaCA
```

- the long string represents html generated by component in enccoded format
- Testing Playground notes
  - terminal on left has querySelector code that will probably work to select ouru element 100% of the time
  - suggested query on right is green or blue and it may or may not be possible to use it directly as suggested
  - another downside, we are trying to find the rows but we can't click on the row, only the cells
    - can add custom styling to the html directly in top-left panel
    - add padding, and will be easier to click
- add this inline to the element you want to click on and find

```js
style = "border: 10px solid red; display: block;";
```

- our find and assertion:

```js
const rows = screen.getAllByRole("row");

// assertion: correct number of rows in the table
expect(rows).toHaveLength(2);
```

- however, there's a header row, so we fail the test

---

## 22 Query Function escape hatches

- it may not be possible to find only the elements we need solely using ARIA roles
- fallbacks (escape hatch) when role doesn't work that well
  - data-testid
  - container.querySelector()
- using data-testid
  - we add a `data-testid` attribute to our actual component
  - UserList.jsx:

```js
return (
  <Wrapper>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Email</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody data-testid="users">{renderedUsers}</tbody>
  </Wrapper>
);
```

- add `within` to our test file:

```js
import { render, screen, within } from "@testing-library/react";
```

- update the query:

```js
// find the rows
const rows = within(screen.getByTestId("users")).getAllByRole("row");
```

- adding data-testid to our element means we can find it in our test
- when we find it, then we can find elements within it that match our role
- we're modifying the component purely to test it
  - not necessarily a great solution

---

## 23. Another query function fallback

- `container.querySelector()`
- when we call `render()` we get back an obj that has helper properties
  - one of these is `container`
  - so we can destructure:

```js
const { container } = render(<UserList users={users} />);
```

- container is a ref to a html element auto added into our component
- you can see this extra element in Testing Playground, there is an extra outer div element added
- we can do this:

```js
// find the rows
const rows = container.querySelectorAll("tbody tr");
```

- note, data-testid is more preferred

---

## 24. Testing Table Contents

- find the cells and make sure the data is appearing on screen:

```js
test("render the name and email of each user", () => {
  const users = [
    { name: "gavan", email: "gavan@email.com" },
    { name: "sam", email: "sam@email.com" },
  ];
  // render
  render(<UserList users={users} />);
  // find
  for (let user of users) {
    const name = screen.getByRole("cell", { name: user.name });
    const email = screen.getByRole("cell", { name: user.email });
    expect(name).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(email).toBeInTheDocument();
  }
});
```

---

## 25. Avoiding BeforeEach

- we have two tests in UserList and both tests share code. They both declare a list of users and render a component
- we can extract the duplicate code into a helper function
- the helper function:

```js
const renderComponent = () => {
  // render the component
  const users = [
    { name: "gavan", email: "gavan@email.com" },
    { name: "sam", email: "sam@email.com" },
  ];
  render(<UserList users={users} />);
  return { users };
};
```

- we can now call this in each test
- Jest provides a `beforeEach()` function that you can use for this
  - you will get a warning if you try to render a component inside of a beforeEach
  - RTL prefers writing fns like renderComponent instead
- complete UserList.test.js:

```js
import { render, screen, within } from "@testing-library/react";
import UserList from "./UserList";

const renderComponent = () => {
  // render the component
  const users = [
    { name: "gavan", email: "gavan@email.com" },
    { name: "sam", email: "sam@email.com" },
  ];
  render(<UserList users={users} />);
  return { users };
};

test("render one row per user", () => {
  renderComponent();
  // render the component

  // find the rows
  const rows = within(screen.getByTestId("users")).getAllByRole("row");

  // assertion: correct number of rows in the table
  expect(rows).toHaveLength(2);
});

test("render the name and email of each user", () => {
  const { users } = renderComponent();
  // find
  for (let user of users) {
    const name = screen.getByRole("cell", { name: user.name });
    const email = screen.getByRole("cell", { name: user.email });
    expect(name).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(email).toBeInTheDocument();
  }
});
```

---

## 26. Testing the whole app

- now we test App.jsx
- create App.test.js
- we use `screen.debug()` here which prints our html out to the terminal

```js
<body>
  <div>
    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="name">Enter name</label>
        <input id="name" type="text" value="jane" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <label for="email">Enter email</label>
        <input id="email" type="email" value="jane@email.com" />
      </div>
      <button>Add User</button>
    </form>
    <hr />
    <table class="sc-bdnyFh juQPKC">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Email</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody data-testid="users">
        <tr>
          <td>jane</td>
          <td>jane@email.com</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
</body>
```

- this allows us to see that we are going down the right path
  - we have selected the inputs, entered text, clicked the submit button and our user is being rendered to the screen
- our complete App.test.js file:

```js
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import userEvent from "@testing-library/user-event";
import App from "./App.jsx";

test("can receive a new user and show it on a list", async () => {
  // render the component
  render(<App />);
  // find input for name and email and find button

  const nameInput = screen.getByRole("textbox", { name: /enter name/i });
  const emailInput = screen.getByRole("textbox", { name: /enter email/i });
  const button = screen.getByRole("button");

  // enter text in the inputs
  await userEvent.click(nameInput);
  await userEvent.keyboard("jane");
  await userEvent.click(emailInput);
  await userEvent.keyboard("jane@email.com");

  // find submit button and click it
  await userEvent.click(button);

  // make sure we can find new name and email in the table
  const name = screen.getByRole("cell", { name: "jane" });
  const email = screen.getByRole("cell", { name: "jane@email.com" });
  // assertions
  expect(name).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(email).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

---

## 27. A touch of test-driven development

- when we submit our form, our inputs should 'empty out' or be set to empty strings
- we will write the test to make sure this is happening first, and then we will write the code to make it happen (test-driven)
- since this has to do with the form state, we can add a test to UserForm.test.js
- since we're rendering UserForm, it expects an onUserAdd
  - we've already tested that this onUserAdd callback is run with correct args
  - in this case we don't care that it is called
  - therefore, we can simply provide an empty callback:
  ```js
  render(<UserForm onUserAdd={() => {}} />);
  ```
- interestingly, we duplicate a lot of code here. here is the new test in UserForm.test.js:

```js
test("our name and email input fields should be set to empty strings after the form has been submitted", async () => {
  render(<UserForm onUserAdd={() => {}} />);

  const nameInput = screen.getByRole("textbox", { name: /enter name/i });
  const emailInput = screen.getByRole("textbox", { name: /enter email/i });
  const button = screen.getByRole("button");

  await userEvent.click(nameInput);
  await userEvent.keyboard("jane");
  await userEvent.click(emailInput);
  await userEvent.keyboard("jane@email.com");

  await userEvent.click(button);

  expect(nameInput).toHaveValue("");
  expect(emailInput).toHaveValue("");
});
```

- update our UserForm to clear the values/state
  - our new test passes!

---

## 28. Feature Implementation

- did this above, two state setters!

---

## 29. Introducing RTL Book

- rtl book is a CLI interactive cheat sheet for query functions and matchers `rtl-book`
- running rtl-book:

```js
npx rtl-book serve roles-notes.js
```

- roles-notes is just a name we give to a file that will be created by running the command
- running the command creates a new file called roles-notes.js and saves notes in there
  - we can then view in the browser
- rtl-book is actually pretty cool
  - it's an interactive code env with links to docs for various libraries/testing frameworks

---

## 30. A few notes on RTL Book

- close with ctrl+c
- open it again using `npx rtl-book serve roles-notes.js`
- the order of the code cells matters
  - you define a component in a cell
  - you can test it in a cell further down, but not vice-versa
  - in RTL Book we can run render to show the component in a preview window - it doesn't have to be only run in a test

---

## 31 partial rule list

- we create a component in RTL book and render it

```js
const RoleExample = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <a href="/">Link</a>
      <button>button</button>
      <footer>content info</footer>
      <h1>heading</h1>
      <header>banner</header>
      <img src="" alt="description" /> Img
      <input type="checkbox" /> Checkbox
      <input type="number" /> Spinbutton
      <input type="radio" /> Radio
      <input type="text" /> Textbox
      <li>list item</li>
      <ul>listgroup</ul>
    </div>
  );
};

render(<RoleExample />);

## 32 finding elements by role

- we write a test in RTL book:

```js
test("can find element by role", async () => {
  // render the component
  render(<RoleExample />);
  const roles = [
    "link",
    "button",
    "contentinfo",
    "heading",
    "banner",
    "img",
    "checkbox",
    "spinbutton",
    "radio",
    "textbox",
    "listitem",
    "listgroup",
  ];
  for (let role of roles) {
    const element = screen.getByRole(role);
    expect(element).toBeInTheDocument();
  }
});
```

- purpose is to see how we can find various elements by role
- listgroup fails because the actual element role is 'list'
- some roles are less obvious:

  - contentinfo = footer
  - banner = header
  - spinbutton = input with a type of number

  ***

## 33. finding by accessible names

- how do you find a single element when there are two or more elements with the same roles?
- you can use accessible name
- not all elements have accessible names
  - inputs are self-closing and don't have text inside
  - the accessible name is the text inside the element

```js
<button>click</button>
```

- the word 'click' is the accessible name of the button above
- to select or find a button with text submit:

```js
test("can select by accessible name", async () => {
  // render the component
  render(<AccessibleName />);
  const submitButton = screen.getByRole("button", { name: "submit" });
});
```

- better to often use a regular expression

```js
test("can select by accessible name", async () => {
  // render the component
  render(<AccessibleName />);
  const submitButton = screen.getByRole("button", { name: /submit/i });
});
```

- finding two buttons with different accessible names:

```js
test("can select by accessible name", async () => {
  // render the component
  render(<AccessibleName />);
  const submitButton = screen.getByRole("button", { name: /submit/i });
  const cancelButton = screen.getByRole("button", { name: /cancel/ });
  expect(submitButton).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(cancelButton).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

## 34. Linking inputs to labels

- in some cases, inputs, there is no text in between.
- we can use accessible names with inputs by adding a label
- component to test:

```js
const MoreNames = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <label>Email</label>
      <input type="text" id="email" />
      <label>Search</label>
      <input type="text" />
    </div>
  );
};

render(<MoreNames />);
```

- test:

```js
const emailInput = screen.getByRole("textbox", { name: /email/i });
```

- fails because there is no link between the label and the input
- we need to use `htmlFor` and `id`

```js
   <label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
      <input type="text" id="email" />
```

- and assertions:

```js
expect(emailInput).toBeInTheDocument();
expect(searchInput).toBeInTheDocument();
```

- and it works
